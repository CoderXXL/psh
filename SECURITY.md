## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security issue, we advice you to _not_ create a issue on GitHub for that as 
it could put all systems using psh on risk. 
Please send a e-mail to [P.Zarrad@outlook.de](mailto:P.Zarrad@outlook.de) to report such  issues.
We take security issues serious and will not create an GitHub issue for any critical security issue 
until we have supplied a fix. All communication with the contributor of the issue will be held through e-mail
till we are at a state to release information about the issue publicly.
